PROBLEM
======
There are N cities, and M buses that travel from one city to another. We aim to minimize the bus cost from city A to city B. Print the minimum cost to travel from city A to city B. The cities are numbered from 1 to N.

INPUT
======
The first line provides the number of cities, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000). The second line provides the number of buses, M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100,000). From the third line to the M+2 line, information about the buses is given as follows. First, the starting city of the bus is given. Next, the destination city and the bus cost are provided. The bus cost is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100,000.
<br>
On the M+3 line, the starting city number and the destination city number are given, which we aim to calculate. The input only includes cases where it is possible to travel from the starting point to the destination.

OUTPUT
======
Print the minimum cost from the starting city to the destination city on the first line.
